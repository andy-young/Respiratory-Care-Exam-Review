## Storage and control of medical gases

E & H cylinder duration formulae:
 
```js
function eCylinder(flowRate, stopPSI=0) {
    const time = (1800 - stopPSI) * 0.28 / flowRate / 60;
    return `E cylinder duration: ${time} hours.`;
}

console.log(eCylinder(4, 200)); // E cylinder duration: 1.866666666666667 hours.

function hCylinder(flowRate, stoPSI=0) {
	const time = (2200 - stopPSI) * 3.14 / flowRate / 60;
	return `H cylinder duration: ${time} hours.`;
}

console.log(hCylinder(8)); // H cylinder duration: 14.391666666666667 hours.
```

The liquid O<sub>2</sub> system duration formula:

```js
function liquid(flowRate, lbs) {
    const time = lbs * 344 / flowRate / 60;
    return `Liquid O2 duration: ${time} hours.`;
}

console.log(liquid(3, 5)) // 'Liquid O2 duration: 9.555555555555555 hours.'
```

## O<sub>2</sub> Therapy

### Complications of O<sub>2</sub> Therapy

1. Respiratory Depression: In COPD patients maintain PaO<sub>2</sub> 50-65 mmHg.
1. Atelectasis: High O<sub>2</sub> üëâüèª nitrogen washout üëâüèª reduce surfactant üëâüèª FiO<sub>2</sub> below 0.60.
1. O<sub>2</sub> toxicity: free radicals --> ARDs
1. Reduced mucociliary action: FiO<sub>2</sub> below 0.60.
1. Retinopath of prematurity: PaO<sub>2</sub> below 80 mmHg--infants 50-70 mmHg


> ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiply any oxygen percentage breathed by 5 to get the PaO<sub>2</sub>.
> If the patient's PaO<sub>2</sub> is approximately 5 times the O<sub>2</sub>
> then titrate or discontinue if titration is not an option.
> 
> For the hypoxemic ventilating well, using 60% or more, use CPAP. If
> contraindicated due to hypotnesion, low cardiac output or high ICP, increase
> FiO<sub>2</sub>.


### Anemic Hypoxia

Anemic hypoxia is when O<sub>2</sub> is reduced in the blood and therefore the
tissues. A decrease in Hb, commonly 12-16 g/dL, may be present.

The PaO<sub>2</sub> may be normal but the carrying capacity may be low. We
need to know the Hb status, and we can help by providing packed RBCs.

CO poisoning is addressed by increasing PaO<sub>2</sub> with a 100% oxygen non-rebreather.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è For the CO patient, always pick the device delivering 100% oxygen.

PaO<sub>2</sub> can be elevated with hyperbaric therapy. Treat patients from
fire and car fumes immediately.

SaO<sub>2</sub> may be in normal range for patients with severe hypoxia.
The level of CO bound to Hb (carboxy-hemoglobin) may be determined with CO
oximetry.

The patient usually presents with a normal PaO<sub>2</sub> level and a low or normal
PaCO<sub>2</sub> level. The pH lvl is usual low as a result of lactic acidosis (metabolic
acidosis) caused by sever hypoxia. Lactic acid is produced as the body goes into
anaerobic metabolish, trying to provide more O<sub>2</sub> to the tissues.

**The following blood gas result on 100% O<sub>2</sub> may be observed with patients exposed to CO:**

| Blood | Values |
|-------|--------|
|pH | 7.24 |
|PaCO<sub>2</sub> | 26 mmHg |
|PaO<sub>2</sub> | 255 mmHg |
|HCO3 | 15 mEq/L|
|B.E.| -10 mEq/L|
|SaO<sub>2</sub>| 60% |
|CoHb| 40% |

- This patient is experiencing extreme hypoxemia. Even though there is high PaO<sub>2</sub>, the Hb can't saturate due to CO. Raise FiO<sub>2</sub> until SaO<sub>2</sub> is around 95%.
- Anemia, from blood loss needs RBCs.
- Methemoglobin causes anemic hypoxia from nitrite poisoning. Use ascorbic acid or methylene blue which removesn the chemical (nitrite) from the system.
- Iron deficiency leads to anemia and is treated by increasing iron intake and administering RBCs.

**Blood carries O<sub>2</sub> in 2 ways:**
1. Bound to Hb: 1g of Hb carries 1.34 mL of O<sub>2</sub>. (1.34 * Hb * SaO<sub>2</sub>) = O<sub>2</sub> mL/dL of blood.
2. Dissolved in plasma: 0.003 mL of O<sub>2</sub> dissolves in plasma for every 1 mmHg of O<sub>2</sub> tension (PaO<sub>2</sub>), or (0.003 * PaO<sub>2</sub>).

**Calculate the patient's total arterial O<sub>2</sub> content:**

|Blood|Values|
|-----|------|
|pH|7.42|
|PCO<sub>2</sub>|41 mmHg|
|PO<sub>2</sub>|90 mmHg|
|SaO<sub>2</sub>|98%|
|Hb|15 g/dL|

- O<sub>2</sub> bound to Hb = 1.34 * 15 * .98 = 19.7 mL/dL
- O<sub>2</sub> dissolved in plasma = 0.003 * 90 = 0.27 mL/dL
- **Total arterial O<sub>2</sub> content = 19.7 mL + 0.27 mL = 19.97 mL/dL**

>  ‚ö†Ô∏è There is no need to calculate O<sub>2</sub> dissolved in plasma. Just calculate O<sub>2</sub> bound to Hb and pick the number slightly higher.
