## Storage and control of medical gases

E & H cylinder duration formulae:
 
```js
function eCylinder(flowRate, stopPSI=0) {
    const time = (1800 - stopPSI) * 0.28 / flowRate / 60;
    return `E cylinder duration: ${time} hours.`;
}

console.log(eCylinder(4, 200)); // E cylinder duration: 1.866666666666667 hours.

function hCylinder(flowRate, stoPSI=0) {
	const time = (2200 - stopPSI) * 3.14 / flowRate / 60;
	return `H cylinder duration: ${time} hours.`;
}

console.log(hCylinder(8)); // H cylinder duration: 14.391666666666667 hours.
```

The liquid O<sub>2</sub> system duration formula:

```js
function liquid_O2(flowRate, lbs) {
    const time = lbs * 344 / flowRate / 60;
    return `Liquid O2 duration: ${time} hours.`;
}

console.log(liquid_O2(3, 5)) // 'Liquid O2 duration: 9.555555555555555 hours.'
```

## O<sub>2</sub> Therapy

### Complications of O<sub>2</sub> Therapy

1. Respiratory Depression: In COPD patients maintain PaO<sub>2</sub> 50-65 mmHg
1. Atelectasis: High O<sub>2</sub>--Nitrogen washout--reduce
surfactant--FiO<sub>2</sub> below 0.60.
1. O<sub>2</sub> toxicity: free radicals--ARDS--
1. Reduced mucociliary action: FiO<sub>2</sub> below 0.60.
1. Retinopath of prematurity: PaO<sub>2</sub> below 80 mmHg--infants 50-70 mmHg


> Multiply any oxygen percentage breathed by 5 to get the PaO<sub>2</sub>.
> If the patient's PaO<sub>2</sub> is approximately 5 times the O<sub>2</sub>
> then titrate or discontinue if titration is not an option.


> For the hypoxemic ventilating well, using %60 or more, use CPAP. If
> contraindicated due to hypotnesion, low cardiac output or high ICP, increase
> FiO<sub>2</sub>.


### Anemic Hypoxia

Anemic hypoxia is when O<sub>2</sub> is reduced in the blood and therefore the
tissues. A decrease in Hb, commonly 12-16 g/dL, may be present.

The PaO<sub>2</sub> may be normal but the carrying capacity may be low. We
need to know the Hb status, and we can help by providing packed RBCs.

CO poisoning is addressed by increasing PaO<sub>2</sub> with 100% oxygen non-rebreather.

> For the CO patient, always pick the device delivering 100% oxygen.

PaO<sub>2</sub> can be elevated with hyperbaric therapy. Treat patients from
fire and car fumes immediately.

SaO<sub>2</sub> may be in normal range for patients with severe hypoxia.
The level of Co bound to Hb (carboxy-hemoglobin) may be determined with CO
oximetry.

The patient usually presents with a normal PaO3 level and al low or normal
PaCO2 level. The pH lvl is usual low as a result of lactic acidosis (metabolic
acidosis) caused by sever hypoxia. Lactic acid is produced as the boy goes into
anaerobic metabilish trying to provide more O2 to th etissues.

The following blood gass result on 100% O2 may be observed with patients
exposed to CO:

| Blood | Values |
|-------|--------|
|pH | 7.24 |
|PaCO2 | 26 mmHg |
|PaO2 | 255 mmHg |
|HCO3 | 15 mEq/L|
|B.E.| -10 mEq/L|
|SaO2| 60% |
|CoHb| 40% |

This patient is experiencing extreme  hypoxemia. Even though there is high
PaO2, the Hb can't saturate due to CO. Raise FiO2 until SaO2 is around 95%.

Anemia, from blood loss needs RBCs.

Methemoglobin causes anemic hypoxia form nitrite poisoning. Use ascorbic acid
or methylene blue wich removes the chemical (nitrite) from the system.

Iron deficiency leads to anemia and is treated by inceasing iron intake and
administering blood.

Blood carries O2 in 2 ways:
1. Bound to Hb: 1 g of Hb carries 1.34 mL of O2. (1.34 * Hb * SaO2) = O2 mL/dL
of blood.
2. Dissolved in plasma: 0.003 mL of O2 dissolves in plasma for every 1 mmHg of
O2 tension (PaO2), or (0.003 * PaO2).

Calculate the patient's total arterial O2 content:

|Blood|Values|
|-----|------|
|pH|7.42|
|PCO2|41 mmHg|
|PO2|90 mmHg|
|SaO2|98%|
|Hb|15 g/dL|

O2 bound to Hb = 1.34 * 15 * .98 = 19.7 mL/dL
O2 dissolved in plasma = 0.003 * 90 = 0.27 mL/dL

Total arterial O2 content = 19.7 mL + 0.27 mL = 19.97 mL/dL

> No need to calculate O2 dissolved in plasma. Just calculate O2 bound to Hb
> and pick the answer just above it.
