## HUMIDITY THERAPY

### Humidity Defined

**Humidity**  is the quantity of moisture in air or gas that is caused by the
addition of water in a gaseous state (vapor). It is also referred as
*molecular water* or *invisible moisture*.

> :warning: The objective of humidity therapy is to make up for water loss that
> occurs when dry gas, more than 4 L/min, is delivered or when the upper airway
> is bypassed. Prolonged inhalation  of dry gas may damage the epithelial layer
> of the airway, reduce ciliary activity, and increase the production of thick
> mucus due to dehydration.

### Clinical Uses of Humidity

- To humidify dry therapeutic gases when flow is greater than 4L/min.
- To provide 100% body humidity of the inspired gas for patients with ET tubes
  or tracheostomy tubes.

### Normal Airway Humidification

- The nose warms, humidifies, and filters inspired air.
- The pharynx,trachea, and bronchial tree also warm, humidify, and filter
  inspired air.
- By the time inspired air reaches the oropharynx, it has been warmed to
  approximately 34° C and is 80% to 90% saturated with H<sub>2</sub>O.
- By the time the inspired air reaches the carina, it has been warmed to body
  temperature (37° C) and is 100% saturated.
- When the inspired air is fully saturated (100%) at 37° C, it holds 44 mg
  H<sub>2</sub>O per liter of gas and exerts a water vapor pressure of 47 mmHg.

### Absolute and Relative Humidity

- Absolute humidity is the amount of water in a given volume of gas; its
  measurement is expressed in milligrams per liter.

- Relative humidity is a ratio between the amount of water in a given volume of
  gas and the maximum amount it is capable of holding at the temperature
(capacity). Its measurement is expressed as a percentage and is obtained with a
hygrometer.

- `Relative humidity = (Absolute humidity / Capacity) * 100`

> :question: The amount of moisture in a given volume of gas at 31° C is 24 mg
> H<sub>2</sub>O per liter of gas. Calculate the relative humidity. (Note: At
> 31° C, air can hold 32.01 mg H<sub>2</sub>O per liter.)

### Body Humidity

- Body humidity is the relative humidity at body temperature and is expressed
  as a percentage.

- `Body humidity = (absolute humidity / 44 mg/L) * 100`
> :warning: **The capacity of water at body temperature is 44 mg/L.**

### Humidity Deficit

- Inspired air, not fully saturated at body temperature creates humidity
deficit. The deficit is corrected by the body's own humidification system.

- Humidity deficit may be expressed in milligrams per liter or as a percentage.

- **Humidity deficit = 44mg/L - absolute humidity**, or when expressed as a
  percent:

> *(Humidity deficit (mg/L) / 44 mg/L)* * 100
