  - symptoms that the patient has and when they started
  - Past medical problems
  - Occupation
  - Medications currently prescribed
  - Allergies
  - Exercise tolerance and daily activities
  - Living environment
  - Nutritional status
  - social support systems available
  - smoking history
  - Alcohol or drug use

## II. ASSESSMENT OF SYMPTOMS

- **Common Symptoms in Pulmonary Disease**
  - **Cough:** aids in clearing the airway of secretions
    - Nonproductive cough is caused by:
      - Irritated airway
      - mucosal membranes
      - Presence of a growth
      - Irritated pleura
      - Irritated tympanic membrane
    - Productive cough sputum colors
      - White or translucent contains normal mucus
      - Yellow is infection, WBCs (purulent sputum)
      - Green is old sputum, if foul smelling suspect ***Pseudomonas***.
      - Brown is old blood
      - Red: contains fresh blood

   > :warning: Foul-smelling sputum that settles into layers is characteristic of ***bronchiectasis***.

  - When a cough  is productive, it is important to record the amount, consistency, odor and color of sputum because changes in these qualities over 24 hours are important in the diagnosis of pulmonary disease.
  - Sputum collection and laboratory analysis are important parts of the
   pulmonary assessment. Steps in sputum collection:
    - Explain to the patient the intent to collect a sample.
    - Good oral hygiene prevents the collection from being
    contaminated by oral secretions.
    - The sputum sample must be from a deep cough.
    - Aerosolized hypertonic saline makes patients cough up
    secretions.

  > :white_check_mark: If a patient cannot cough adequately, nasotracheal suctioning may be necessary to collect the sample. To collect the sputum, a sputum trap or a Lukens tube catheter is necessary.

  - Characteristics of a cough:
    - Bark-like cough usually indicates croup.
    - Harsh, dry cough with inspiratory stridor usually indicates
    upper airway problems.
    - Wheezing type coughs usually indicate lover airway pathology.
    - Chronic productive coughs are indicative of chronic
    bronchitis.
    - Prequent hacking cough and throat clearing may be the result
    of smoking or sinus or viral infection.
  
- **Dyspnea** is patient's complaint of difficult or labored breathing.
  - It is a subjective symptom, meaning that the patient expresses breathing difficulty, and can be influenced by their reactions and emotional state.

  > :white_check_mark: A patient who has dyspne of tachypnea is often said to be hyperventilating: however, the only way to determine whether someone is hyperventilating is to observe ABG results indicating a CO<sub>2</sub> level less than normal.

  - Causes of dyspnea:
    - Increased airway resistance
    - Upper airway obstruction
    - Asthma and other chronic lung diseases
    - Decreased lung compliance
    - Pulmonary fibrosis
    - Pneumothorax
    - Pleural effusion
    - Abnormal chest wall
    - Anxiety state, when there isno physiologic explanation

  - Types of dyspnea
    - Orthopnea is dyspnea while lying down. The condition is usually seen in patients with heart failure and is caused by increased congestionof the lungs while lying down. It is often observed in patients with emphyasema bcause of the inadequete diaphragmatic movement during ventiilaiton. It is often rreferrred to as 2-pillow or 3-pillow orthopnea to evaluate the number of pillow required to relieve dyspnea.
    - Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea is sudden onset of shortness of breath after being in bed for several hours. It is seen in cardiac patients and results in acute pulmonary edema, which usually subsides quickly after the patient is positioned upright.
    - Exertional dyspnea is often seen in patients with cardiopulmonary disease. The severity is determined by the amount of exertion. It is important to determine at what point the patinet experiences dyspnea: Does it begin after walking up a flight of stairs or after simply walking across the room?

- **Hemoptysis** is coughing up blood from the respiratory tract.
  - Varies in severity from blood-tinged or blood-streaked sputum to frank bleeding.
  - Massive hemptysis is defined as 400 mL of blood-tinged sputum in 2 hours or as more than 600 mL in 24 hours and is considered a life-threatening event. An adequate airway must be maintained immediately, with a bronchoscopy or surgery possible indicated.
  - Causes of hemoptysis:
    - Pneumonia
    - Tuberculosis (massive hemoptysis possible)
    - Lung abscess
    - Fungal lung infection: ***histoplasmosis***
    - Neoplasms: bronchogenic carcinoma (massive hemoptysis possible)
    - Pulmonary embolism
    - Valvular heart diseases
    - Mitral valve stenosis
  - Patients may think they are "coughing up blood" from the lungs when the blood is actually from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Thor origin of the blood must be determined, typically by bronchoscopy.

- **Chest pain**
  - The thoracic wall is the most common source of chest pain.
  - the pain may be from nerves, muscles, or the skin or bones of the thoracic wall.
  - The lung parenchyma is *not sensitive to pain*.
  - The parietal pleura (layer lining the ches wall) is very sensitive to pain and is usually the source of pain associated with pneumonias, pleurisy, and other inflammatory processess. Chest pain during inspiration is common.
  - Chest pain may be associated with pulmonary hypertension caused by the increased tension on the walls of the vessels and by increased worklaod on the right side of the heart.
  - Chest pain is also associated with a ruptured aorta, myocardial infartction, and esophageal problems.

## III. OTHER PHYSICAL ASSESSMENTS

- **Breathing Patterns**
  - **Eupnea:** the normal rate and depth of respirations.
    - Adults: 12 to 20 bpm.
    - Children: 15 to 25 bpm.
    - Newborn: 35 to 45 bpm (as high as 70 with excitement)
  - **Bradypnea:** less than the normal respiratory rate. May be seen with respiratory center depression caused by head trauma or drug overdose.
- **Apnea:** absence of breathing for a specific period of time (usually at least 10 seconds). Seen in patients with respiratory arrest caused by asphyxia, severe drug overdose, central and obstructive sleep apnea, and other central respiratory center disorders.
  - **Tachypnea:** faster than the normal respiratory rate but with the normal depth of breathing. May indicate decreased lung compliance and is associated with restrictive diseases, pneumonia, and pulmonary edema.
  - **Hypopnea:** shallow respirations (about half of normal depth) with slower than normal respiratory rate. Hypopnea is normal in well-conditioned athletes and is accompanied by a slow pulse rate. May be seen in patients with damage to the brainstem and is accompanied by a weak, rapid pulse or in patients with obstructive sleep apnea.
  - **Hyperpnea:** deep, rapid, and labored breathing. Associated with conditions on which there is an inadequate O<sub>2</sub> supply, such as cardiac and respiratory diseases. Usually refers to hyperventilation.
  - **Kussmaul respiration:** increased rate and depth of breathing. Usually seen in patients with severe metabolic acidosis (diabetic ketoacidosis).
  - **Biot respiration:** irregular breathing pattern characterized by short periods of deep, consistent volumes with periods of apnea. The apneic period may last 10 to 30 seconds. Associated with elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) or meningitis.
  - **Cheyne-Stokes respiration:** deep, rapid breathing followed by apnea. The breaths begin slowly and shallowly and gradually increase to above normal volume and rate, then gradually diminish in volume and rate, followed by apnea. Apnea may last 10 to 20 seconds before the cycle is repeated. Seen with respiratory center depression caused by stroke or head injury, pneumonia in the elderly, CHF, or drug overdose.

- **Chest inspection:** This should be performed with the patient seated and with clothing removed above the waist. If the patient is not able to sit in a chair, he or she should be placed in bed in Fowler position (e.g., head of bed elevated 45°). **Inspection should include:**
  - The rate, depth, and regularity of breathing compared with the norms for the patient's age and activity level.
  - Skin color, temperature, and condition, such as bruises or scars. Is the patient diaphoretic?
  - Chest symmetry: Compare one side of the chest with the other.
    - Observe chest excursion while standing in front of the patient to determine whether both sides are expanding equally.
    - Unequal expansion may indicate:
      - Atelectasis
      - Pneumothorax
      - Chest deformities
      - Flail Chest: **Paradoxical** respiations may be observed in which the chest moves in on inspiration and out on expiration. Flail chest is the result of chest trauma, a fractured sternum, or fractured ribs.
    - Shape and size of chest: in comparison with norms
      - Observe the antero-posterior (A-P) diameter.
      - An increased A-P diameter is called a **barrel chest and is indicative of chronic lung desease.**
    - Work of breathing:
      - Should be evaluated to determine the level of breathing difficulty.
      - While observing the patient's breathing process, determine the following factor:
        - Is the chest movement symmetric?
        - Are the accessory muscles being used?
        - What is the shape of the chest?
        - What is the respiratory rate?
        - Is the breathing pattern regular or irregular?
        - Are there any bony deformities of the ribs, spine, or chest?
        - Is the patient's V<sub>T</sub> normal in relation to size and age?
        - Is expiration prolonged, shorter than inspiration, or equal to inspiration?
        - Are substernal, suprasternal, or intercostal retactions or nasal flaring observed?
        - **These are all signs of respiratory distress!**

> :warning: The intercostal muscles and diaphragm are the major muscles for normal ventilation. The accessory muscles are the scalene and the sternomastoid muscles in the neck and the pectoralis major muscle in the anterior chest. When accessory muscles are used during ventilation, it is a sign of respiratory distress. It is the overuse of accessory muscles with chronic obstruive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients that results in an increased A-P diameter.

- **Inspection of the Extremities**
  - **Digital clubbing**
    - Digital clubbing is indicative of long-standing pulmonary disease: 75% to 85% of all clubbing is the result of pulmonary disease.
    - Consists of enlargement of the distal phalanges of the fingers and, less commonly, the toes. There is a loss of the angle between the nail and dorsum of the terminal phalanx.
    - It is the reuslt of **chronic hypoxemia**.
  - **Pedal Edema**
    - This refers to an accumulation of fluid in the subcutaneous tissues of the ankles.
    - This symptom is commonly obsverved in patients with chronic pulmonary disease, in which their chronic hypoxemic state resuls in pulmonary vasoconstriction.
    - The right side of the heart works harder as it pumps blood through narrowed pulmonary vessels, which results in an increased workload on the right side of the heart, right ventriclar hypertrophy, and, eventually, right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale).
    - As right-sided heart pressures increase, venous blood flow returning to the heart is diminished, and the peripheral blood vessels become engorged. The ankles are most affected as a result of gravity. This is often accompanied by jugular venous distention (JVD). The jugular veins returning blood from the upper body also become engorged as a result of elevated pressure in the right side of the heart.
  - **Cyanosis**
    - Refers to the bluish discoloration of the skin and nail beds resulting from a **5 g/dL decrease in oxygenated hemoglobin (Hb)**. For example, a patient with an Hb level of 1 g/dL would have cyanosis if the O<sub>2</sub> saturation dropped to a level where only 10 g/dL was saturated with O<sub>2</sub>.
    - **Central cyanosis** is present when the oral mucosa and trunk are cyanotic and indicates inadequate tissue oxygenation. **Peripheral cyanosis** (acrocyanosis) is present when the nail beds are cyanotic and may indicate poor perfusion caused by decreased cardiac output, hypotension, or cold temperature.
    - Patients with decreased Hb levels (anemia) may not exhibit cyanosis even if tissue hypoxia is present. An anemic patient has a low O<sub>2</sub>-carrying capacity, which may result in tissue hypoxia but does not cause cyanosis unless 5 g/dL of unsaturated Hb is present. If there is not enough Hb in the blood to manifest it, cyanosis will not occur.
    - Conversely, a patinet with an increased level of Hb (polycythemia) has an increased capacity for carrying O<sub>2</sub>. This patient may have a level of 5 g/dL of unsaturated Hb and therefore may have cyanosis, yet have enough saturated Hb to adequately oxygenate the tissues.
  - **Capillary refill**
    - Perfusion to the extremities may be determined by assessing capillary refill.
    - This is performed by compressing the patient's fingernail for a short itme, then releasing it and observing the time it takes for blood flow to return to the nail bed.
    - Normal refill time is less than 3 seconds.
    - Patients with decreased cardiac output and poor digital perfusion have a longer refill time.
  - **Chest Deformities**
    - **Kyphosis**
      - Concave curvature of the spine, resulting in a "hunchback" appearance. It is best assessed from an anterior view.
      - Caussed by degenerative bone disease or age or may be seen with COPD.
    - **Lordosis**
      - Backward curvature of the lumbar spine, resulting in a "swayback" appearance.
      - Usually not a cause of respiratory difficulties.
    - **Scoliosis**
      - Lateral curvature of the thoracic pine, resulting in chest protrusion posteriorly and the anterior ribs flattening out. Chest protrudes on right or left side.
      - Depending on severity, it may result in impeared lung movement.
    - **Kyphoscoliosis**
      - Combination of kyphosis and scoliosis.
      - May be most adequately observed by notiving different heights of the shoulders.
      - Cardiopulmonary problems do not normally present until patients rach their 40s or 50s.
      - Pulmonary signs and symptoms of kyphoscoliosis:
        - Dyspea
        - Hypoxemia
        - Hypercapnia
        - Progressive respiratory insufficiency
        - Cardiac failure
        - Decreased lung capacity as evidenced by results of pulmonary function tests **(restrictive desease)**
        - Frequent pulmonary infections
        - Uneven ventilation/perfusion ratio
      - **Pectus carinatum**
        - Also called *pigeon breast*; results in the forward projection of the xiphoid process and lower sternum.
        - usually a congenital condition.
        - May cause dyspnea on exercise and more frequent respiratory infections as a result of interference with heart and lung movement.
        - In sever cases, surgical correction may be indicated.
      - **Pectus Excavatum**
        - Also called *funnel chest*; results in a funnel-shaped depression over the lower sternum.
        - Usually a congenital condition.
        - May lead to dyspnea on exertion and more frequent respiratory infections.
      - **Barrel Chest**
        - The natural recoil properties of thelungs are decreased because of air trapping and subsequent hyperinflation. this loss of lung elasticity causes the ribs tomovemmore outward, which causes the barrel appearance.
        - The increased tone and development of the accessory muscles, which are used during breathing by patients with COPD, also contribute to the barrel appearance.
        - Seen almost exclusively in patiens with chronic lung disease.
        - This hkyperinflated state of the lungs pushes down on the diaphragm, which restricts its movement. The diaphragm is a done-shaped muscle that is innervated by the phrenic nerve. contraction of the muscle causes a descease in pressure within the lungs below atmospheric levels, and air enters the airway. Hyperinflated lungs tend to flatten the diaphragm, diminishing its contracting ability. This decreased alveolar ventilaiton and chest excursion, which results in labored breathing.
        - Muscles normally used for ventilation are the **diaphragm and external intercostals**, but because the diaphragm of patients with COPD is flattened, they use their accessory muscles during normal ventilation.
      - **Palpation of the Chest**
        - Use the sense of touch on the chest wall to assess physical signs.
        - Hands are placed on the chest to assess chest meovement and vibration.
        - Vibrations felt on the chest wall as the patient speaks are called *tactile fremitus*. The vibrations originate at the vocal cords and are transmitted down the tracheobronchial tree, through the alveoli to the chest wall.
          - the practitioner places his or her hands on the patient's chest and asks the patient to say certain words, such as 'ninety-nine," as the practitioner palpates ver different areas of the chest.
          - Vibrations are **decreased** over pleural effusions, fluid, pneumothorax, and in overly muscular or obese patients.
          - Vibrations are **increased** over atelactasis, pneumonia, and lung masses.
        - For patiens with suspected chest trauma or after thoracic...
