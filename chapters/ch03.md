# Chapter 3: Assessment of the Cardiopulmonary Patient

## Study Questions

1. What is yellow sputum indicative of?

foul smelling?
3. List nine causes of dyspnea.

found?
5. Describe Kussmaul respirations and identify which patients most often
exhibit this breathing pattern.

7. Describe paradoxical respiration and name a condition in which it is most
commonly observed.
8. Define pedal edema and identify its cause.
9. Name a condition that results in the trachea shifting toward the side of the body that the condition is  affecting.
10. Name a condition that results in the trachea shifting away from the
affected side.
11. Which muscles are used for normal ventilation?
12. What causes the barrel chest appearance in patients with COPD? 
13. Name two conditions in which a hyperresonant percussion note would be
heard.

15. List four conditions that result in heart murmurs.
16. List the normal values for the following electrolytes:
	- sodium
	- potassium
	- chloride
17. Why would decreased sodium and potassium levels make weaning a patient from
the ventilator more difficult?
18. What does an elevated BUN level indicate?
19. How does the respiratory system compensate when glucose levels increase in
a diabetic patient?
20. List the normal levels for each of the following:
	- RBC count
	- Hb level
	- Hct 
	- WBC count
21. What do decreases in Hb level, Hct, and RBC count indicate?
22. Name two conditions that cause a decreased platelet count.
23. Patients with a decreased platelet count and increased PT are at greater
risk of what occurrence?


## I. PATIENT HISTORY

- The patient interview should obtain this information:
    - chief complaint
    - symptoms that the patient has and when they started
    - Past medical problems
    - Occupation
    - Medications currently prescribed
    - Allergies
    - Exercise tolerance and daily activities
    - Living environment
    - Nutritional status
    - social support systems available
    - smoking history
    - Alcohol or drug use

## II. ASSESSMENT OF SYMPTOMS

- **Common Symptoms in Pulmonary Disease**
	- **Cough:** aids in clearing the airway of secretions
        - Nonproductive cough is caused by:
            - Irritated airway
            - mucosal membranes
            - Presence of a growth
            - Irritated pleura
            - Irritated tympanic membrane
        - Productive cough sputum colors
            - White or translucent contains normal mucus
            - Yellow is infection, WBCs (purulent sputum)
            - Green is old sputum, if foul smelling suspect ***Pseudomonas***
            - Brown is old blood
            - Red: contains fresh blood

> :warning: Foul-smelling sputum that settles into layers is characteristic of ***bronchiectasis***.

	- When a cough  is productive, it is important to record the amount,
	  consistency, odor, and color of sputum because changes in these
qualities over 24 hours are important in the diagnosis of pulmonary disease.
	- Sputum collection and laboratory analysis are important parts of the
	  pulmonary assessment. Steps in sputum collection:
		- Explain to the patient the intent to collect a sample.
		- Good oral hygiene prevents the collection from being
		  contaminated by oral secretions.
		- The sputum sample must be from a deep cough.
		- Aerosolized hypertonic saline makes patients cough up
		  secretions.

		> :white_check_mark: If a patient cannot cough adequately,
		> nasotracheal suctioning may be necessary to collect the
		> sample. To collect the sputum, a sputum trap or a Lukens tube
		> catheter is necessary.

	- Characteristics of a cough:
		- Bark-like cough usually indicates croup.
		- Harsh, dry cough with inspiratory stridor usually indicates upper airway problems.
		- Wheezing type coughs usually indicate lover airway pathology.
		- Chronic productive coughs are indicative of chronic bronchitis.
		- Prequent hacking cough and throat clearing may be the result of smoking or sinus or viral infection. 

    - **Dyspnea** is patient's complaint of difficult or labored breathing.
	
	- It is a subjective symptom, meaning that the patient expresses breathing difficulty, and can be influenced by their reactions and emotional state.			

        > :white_check_mark: A patient who has dyspne of tachypnea is often
        > said to be hyperventilating: however, the only way to determine
        > whether someone is hyperventilating is to observe ABG results
        > indicating a CO<sub>2</sub> level less than normal.

    - Hemoptysis

    - Chest pain
