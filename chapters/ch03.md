# Chapter 3: Assessment of the Cardiopulmonary Patient

## Study Questions

1. What is yellow sputum indicative of?
2. What bacterial organism should be suspected if a patient's sputum is green and
foul smelling?
3. List nine causes of dyspnea.
4. What does the term *orthopnea* mean, and in which patients is it most commonly
found?
5. Describe Kussmaul respirations and identify which patients most often
exhibit this breathing pattern.
6. List three conditions in which asymmetric chest movement may be observed.
7. Describe paradoxical respiration and name a condition in which it is most
commonly observed.
8. Define pedal edema and identify its cause.
9. Name a condition that results in the trachea shifting toward the side of the body that the condition is  affecting.
10. Name a condition that results in the trachea shifting away from the
affected side.
11. Which muscles are used for normal ventilation?
12. What causes the barrel chest appearance in patients with COPD? 
13. Name two conditions in which a hyperesonant percussion note would be
heard.
14. Name two conditions in which a dull percussion note would be heard.
15. List four conditions that result in heart murmurs.
16. List the normal values for the following electrolytes:
	- sodium
	- potassium
	- chloride
17. Why would decreased sodium and potassium levels make weaning a patient from
the ventilator more difficult?
18. What does an elevated BUN level indicate?
19. How does the respiratory system compensate when glucose levels increase in
a diabetic patient?
20. List the normal levels for each of the following:
	- RBC count
	- Hb level
	- Hct 
	- WBC count
21. What do decreases in Hb level, Hct, and RBC count indicate?
22. Name two conditions that cause a decreased platelet count.
23. Patients with a decreased platelet count and increased PT are at greater
risk of what occurrence?


## I. PATIENT HISTORY

- The patient interview should obtain this information:
    - chief complaint
    - symptoms that the patient has and when they started
    - Past medical problems
    - Occupation
    - Medications currently prescribed
    - Allergies
    - Exercise tolerance and daily activites
    - Living environment
    - Nutritional status
    - social support systems available
    - smoking hx
    - Alcohol or drug use

## II. ASSESSMENT OF SYMPTOMS

- **Common Symptoms in Pulmonary Disease**
    - **Cough:** aids in clearing the airway of secretions
        - Nonproductive cough is caused by:
            1. Irritated airway
            2. mucosal membranes
            3. Presence of a growth
            4. Irritated pleura
            5. Irritated tympanic membrane
        - Productive cough sputum colors
            - White or translucent contains normal mucus
            - Yellow is infection, WBCs (purulent sputum)
            - Green is old sputum, if foul smelling -> *Pseudomonas*
            - Brown is old blood
            - Foul-smelling in layers -> *bronchiectasis*
        - Aerosolized hypertonic saline makes patients cough up secretions
        - Use nasotracheal suctioning with a Lukens tube & trap if patient can't cough
    - **Dyspnea** is difficulty breathing
        > :white_check_mark: A patient who has dyspne of tachypnea is often
        > said to be hyperventilating: however, the only way to determine
        > whether somone is hyperventilatingis to observe ABG results
        > indicating a CO<sub>2</sub> level less than normal.
    - Hemoptysis
    - Chest pain
