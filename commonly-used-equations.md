# Commonly Used Equations

### 1. Time remaining in an O<sub>2</sub> cylinder

> Minutes remaining = ((Cylinder pressure - stop pressure)) * Cylinder factor) / Liter Flow

Cylinder factors:
- H cylinder: 3.14 L/psig
- E cylinder: 0.28 L/psig

### 2. Duration of flow for liquid O<sub>2</sub> systems

> 344 * liquid wt (lb) / Flow

---

### 3. Total arterial content (CaO<sub>2</sub>), total venous content (CVO<sub>2</sub>) & AV content difference C(a-v)O<sub>2</sub>

The sum total of O<sub>2</sub> bound to hemoglobin and dissolved in the plasma:

> O<sub>2</sub> bound to Hb = 1.34 * Hb * SaO<sub>2</sub>

> O<sub>2</sub> dissolved in plasma = PaO<sub>2</sub> * 0.003

- Use the FiO<sub>2</sub> (fractional concentration) for the SaO<sub>2</sub>, for example 0.95 versus 95%.
- Add the answers to each to determine the CaO<sub>2</sub>.
- Use the same equation for calculating venous content but substitute SvO<sub>2</sub> for SaO<sub>2</sub>, and PvO<sub>2</sub> for PaO<sub>2</sub>.
- Subtract the CVO<sub>2</sub> from the CaO<sub>2</sub> to determine the content difference.

:warning: The amount of dissolved O<sub>2</sub> is so small, do not take the time to calculate it.
Calculate the amount bound to Hb and select the answer on that is slightly higher.

### 4. Total flow delivered by a high-flow O<sub>2</sub> delivery device

Add the air O<sub>2</sub> entrainment ratio parts together and multiply by the
flowmeter setting.

> 40% air-entrainment mask running at 8 L/min.
> 40% air O<sub>2</sub> ratio = 3:1; 3 + 1 = 4; 4 * 8 = 32 L/min

### 5. Determine actual flow rate of He/O<sub>2</sub> mixtures through an O<sub>2</sub> flowmeter

To determine what to set the O<sub>2</sub> flowmeter on to deliver the ordered
heliox flow, divide the factor 1.8 or 1.6 into the ordered flow.

80/20 heliox mixture: multiply flowmeter reading by 1.8
70/30 heliox mixture: multiply flowmeter reading by 1.6

### 6. Relative humidity (RH)

> RH = (Absolute humidity / Capacity) * 100

- Absolute humidity is the amount of water in a given volume of gas.
- Capacity is the total amount of water capable of being held in the gas at a
  given temperature.

---

### 7. Body humidity (BH)

> BH = (Absolute humidity / 44 mg/L) * 100

### 8. Humidity deficit (HD)

> HD = 44 mg/L - Absolute humidity

Expressed as a percentage:

> Humidity deficit (mg/L) / 44 mg/L

---

### 9. Alveolar PO<sub>2</sub> (PAO<sub>2</sub>) using the alveolar air equation

Shortcut equation for the exam when the barometric pressure is 747 torr:

> PAO<sub>2</sub> = (7 * O<sub>2</sub>%) - (PaCO<sub>2</sub> +10)

---

### 10. P(A-a)O<sub>2</sub> (A-a gradient)

> PAO<sub>2</sub> - PaO<sub>2</sub>

---

### 11. Intrapulmonary shunt

> QS/QT = (PAO<sub>2</sub> - PaO<sub>2</sub> / 20) + 3% - 4%

---

### 12. Systemic vascular resistance (SVR)

> ((MSAP - CVP mmHg)) / QT

The answer is in the units, mmHg/L/min. Multiply by 80 to conver to dyne *
seconds * cm<sup>-5</sup>.

QT = cardiac output
MSAP = mean systemic arterial pressure

---

### 13. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR)

(MPAP - PCWP) / QT

- The answer is inthe units, mmHg/L/min.
- Multiply by 80 to convert to dyne * seconds * cm<sup>-5</sup>.
- MPAP = mean pulmonary arterial presssure
- PCWP = pulmonary capillary wedge presssure

---

### 14. Cardiac Output (QT)

Oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>) / ((CaO<sub>2</sub> - CVO<sub>2</sub>) * 10)

---

### 15. Ideal Body Weight (lb)

Female: 105 + 5 (height in inches - 60)
Male: 106 + 6 (height in inches - 60)

- To change from pounds to kilograms, divide your answer by 2.2

#### Exam Note :pencil2:

This equation is used to determine the appropriate ventilator tidal volume
V<sub>T</sub>. Once the wt in lbs is calculated, simply divide the wt in half
and add a zero to the end. This presents a V<sub>T</sub> of approximately 10
mL/kg of body wt.

> My IBW is 140 lbs. Divide by 2 is 70, and a zero for 700. A 700 mL
> V<sub>T</sub> is appropriate for my body weight.

---

### 16. Ventilator Tubing Compliance

V<sub>T</sub> / PIP

Measured by occluding the vent Y adaptor and dividing the peak pressure into
the set V<sub>T</sub>. (The high pressure alarm must be adjusted to maximal
level during the measurement.)

---

### 17. Actual ventilator V<sub>T</sub> delivered

Set V<sub>T</sub> - ((Tubing compliance) * (PIP - PEEP))

---

### 18. Dynamic & Static lung compliance

Dynamic compliance = V<sub>T</sub> / (PIP - PEEP)

Static compliance = V<sub>T</sub> / (Plateau pressure - PEEP)

---

### 19. Inspiratory flow rate

V<sub>T</sub> / Inspiratory time

- Using liters for the V<sub>T</sub>, the answer will be in L/s.
- Multiply by 60 to change to L/min. 

---

### 20. I:E ratio

(Inspiratory flow rate / Minute volume ) - 1

- After dividing the flow rate by the minute volume, subtract 1 from the answer.

#### Example:

The answer is 4. Subtract 1, and the I:E ratio is 1:3.

---

### 21. Inspiratory Time

Total cycle time / Sum of I:E ratio parts

Total cycle time = 60 / Ventilator rate

---

### 22. V<sub>D</sub>/V<sub>T</sub> ratio

(PaCO<sub>2</sub> - PECO<sub>2</sub>) / PaCO<sub>2</sub>

- To calculate dead space ventilation, multiply the ratio by the tidal volume

#### Example:

V<sub>D</sub>/V<sub>T</sub> = 0.40; V<sub>T</sub> is 500 mL
0.40 * 500 = 200 mL of dead space

This means that 200 mL of the patient's V<sub>T</sub> is not reaching the
alveoli. Therefore, 300 mL is reaching the alveoli and is referred to as the
effective V<sub>T</sub>.

### 23. Airway Resistance (R<sub>AW</sub>)

(PIP - Plateau pressure) / Flow rate

### 24. Desire FiO<sub>2</sub> level

PaO<sub>2</sub> (desired value) * FiO<sub>2</sub> (current level) /
PaO<sub>2</sub> (current value)

---

### 25. Desired Ventilator Rate

**Note:** The patient must not be breathing above the set rate while in A/C
mode for this calculation to be accurate.

Rate (current setting) * PaCO<sub>2</sub> (current value) / PaCO<sub>2</sub>
(desired value)

---

### 26. Desired Minute Ventilation (VE)

**Note:** The patient must not be breathing above the set rate while in A/C
mode for this calculation to be accurate.

VE (current level) * PaCO<sub>2</sub> (current level) / PaCO<sub>2</sub>
(desired value)
