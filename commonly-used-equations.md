# Commonly Used Equations

## 1. Calculate time remaining in an O<sub>2</sub> cylinder

> Minutes remaining = ((Cylinder pressure - stop pressure)) * Cylinder factor) / Liter Flow

Cylinder factors:
- H cylinder: 3.14 L/psig
- E cylinder: 0.28 L/psig

## 2. Calculate duration of flow for liquid O<sub>2</sub> systems

> 344 * liquid wt (lb) / Flow

## 3. Calculate total arterial content (CaO<sub>2</sub>), total venous content (CVO<sub>2</sub>) & AV content difference C(a-v)O<sub>2</sub>

The sum total of O<sub>2</sub> bound to hemoglobin and dissolved in the plasma:

> O<sub>2</sub> bound to Hb = 1.34 * Hb * SaO<sub>2</sub>

> O<sub>2</sub> dissolved in plasma = PaO<sub>2</sub> * 0.003

- Use the FiO<sub>2</sub> (fractional concentration) for the SaO<sub>2</sub>, for example 0.95 versus 95%.
- Add the answers to each to determine the CaO<sub>2</sub>.
- Use the same equation for calculating venous content but substitute SvO<sub>2</sub> for SaO<sub>2</sub>, and PvO<sub>2</sub> for PaO<sub>2</sub>.
- Subtract the CVO<sub>2</sub> from the CaO<sub>2</sub> to determine the content difference.

:warning: The amount of dissolved O<sub>2</sub> is so small, do not take the time to calculate it.
Calculate the amount bound to Hb and select the answer on that is slightly higher.
