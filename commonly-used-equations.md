# Commonly Used Equations

### Time remaining in an O<sub>2</sub> cylinder

> Minutes remaining = ((Cylinder pressure - stop pressure)) * Cylinder factor) / Liter Flow

Cylinder factors:
- H cylinder: 3.14 L/psig
- E cylinder: 0.28 L/psig

### Duration of flow for liquid O<sub>2</sub> systems

> 344 * liquid wt (lb) / Flow

### Calculate total arterial content (CaO<sub>2</sub>), total venous content (CVO<sub>2</sub>) & AV content difference C(a-v)O<sub>2</sub>

The sum total of O<sub>2</sub> bound to hemoglobin and dissolved in the plasma:

> O<sub>2</sub> bound to Hb = 1.34 * Hb * SaO<sub>2</sub>

> O<sub>2</sub> dissolved in plasma = PaO<sub>2</sub> * 0.003

- Use the FiO<sub>2</sub> (fractional concentration) for the SaO<sub>2</sub>, for example 0.95 versus 95%.
- Add the answers to each to determine the CaO<sub>2</sub>.
- Use the same equation for calculating venous content but substitute SvO<sub>2</sub> for SaO<sub>2</sub>, and PvO<sub>2</sub> for PaO<sub>2</sub>.
- Subtract the CVO<sub>2</sub> from the CaO<sub>2</sub> to determine the content difference.

:warning: The amount of dissolved O<sub>2</sub> is so small, do not take the time to calculate it.
Calculate the amount bound to Hb and select the answer on that is slightly higher.

### Total flow delivered by a high-flow O<sub>2</sub> delivery device

Add the air O<sub>2</sub> entrainment ratio parts together and multiply by the
flowmeter setting.

> 40% air-entrainment mask running at 8 L/min.
> 40% air O<sub>2</sub> ratio = 3:1; 3 + 1 = 4; 4 * 8 = 32 L/min

### Determine actual flow rate of He/O<sub>2</sub> mixtures through an
O<sub>2</sub> flowmeter

To determine what to set the O<sub>2</sub> flowmeter on to deliver the ordered
heliox flow, divide the factor 1.8 or 1.6 into the ordered flow.

80/20 heliox mixture: multiply flowmeter reading by 1.8
70/30 heliox mixture: multiply flowmeter reading by 1.6

### Calculate relative humidity (RH)

> RH = (Absolute humidity / Capacity) * 100

- Absolute humidity is the amount of water in a given volume of gas.
- Capacity is the total amount of water capable of being held in the gas at a
  given temperature.

### Calculate body humidity (BH)

> BH = (Absolute humidity / 44 mg/L) * 100

### Calculating humidity deficit (HD)

> HD = 44 mg/L - Absolute humidity

Expressed as a percentage:

> Humidity deficit (mg/L) / 44 mg/L

### Calculating Alveolar PO<sub>2</sub> (PAO<sub>2</sub>) using the alveolar air equation

Shortcut equation for the exam when the barometric pressure is 747 torr:

> PAO<sub>2</sub> = (7 * O<sub>2</sub>%) - (PaCO<sub>2</sub> +10)

---

### Calculating P(A-a)O<sub>2</sub> (A-a gradient)

> PAO<sub>2</sub> - PaO<sub>2</sub>

---

### Calculating intrapulmonary shunt

> QS/QT = (PAO<sub>2</sub> - PaO<sub>2</sub> / 20) + 3% - 4%

---

### Calculating systemic vascular resistance (SVR)

> ((MSAP - CVP mmHg)) / QT

HTe anser is in the units, mm Hg/L/min. Multiply by 80 to conver to dyne *
seconds * cm<sup>-5</sup>.

QT = cardiac output
MSAP = mean systemic arterial pressure
